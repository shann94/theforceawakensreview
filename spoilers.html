<H2>But First, Some Facts</H2>

<H3>Disney</h3>
<p>Disney bought Lucas Films (the original creators of Star Wars) a couple years ago. So the original guy (George Lucas) didn't help make this movie.</p>

<H3>The Force</h3>
<ul><li>There's two sides of the force: Dark Side and Light Side. Light side is called the Resistance and the Dark Side is called the First Order</Li>
  <li>Han Solo does not possess the force. Leia does, however. That's why Kylo Ren has the force.</li>
    <li>Rey has the power of the force too... but it has not been revealed to the audience why. I think he is the granddaugher of Obi Won or she is a product of the force-like Anakin Skywalker. </li></ul>

<H2>Spoilers</h2>
  <ul><li>The bad guy, Kylo Ren, is the son of Princess Leia and Han Solor</li>
    <li>Kylo Ren kills Han Solor</li>
    <li>Rey is a Jedi</li>
    <li>Finn is not a Jedi</li>
    <li>Luke has a beard</li>
    <li>R2D2 is immobile most of the movie</li>
  </ul>

<H2>Other Important Information</H2>
<p>Dad said he would take you eventually.</P>
