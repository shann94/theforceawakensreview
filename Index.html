  <H1>My Spectacular Review of Star Wars: "The Force Awakens" </h1>


  <p>A lot of people have been complaining that "The Force Awakens" is the same movie as "A New Hope." While the two movies have their similarities, I believe that the movie writers did it for a strategic reason: get the old and the new fans excited about the next two movies.</P>

    <P><strong>PLOT: LUKE SKYWALKER HAS VANISHED an everyone (even the First Order) really, really needs to know where he is.</strong> <br> The move starts with a sad village on the planet of Joccu at night and one of our heroes, Poe. is retrieving information about his whereabouts. <em> This is ridiculous. </em> Who is this guy? Why him? And by the end of the movie is still doesn't make sense why he was chosen to go find Luke? Why not General Leia? </p>

      <p>Then Kylo Ren shows up and hes all dramatic and angry and orders the storm troopers to kill everyone in the village. Poe and his robot companion, BB8, who is quite frankly the best character in the entire film, take off and Poe gives BB8 the information on Luke. BB8 takes off around Joccu.</p>

       <p>Then Kylo Ren, being a axty teen, freaks out becuase Poe don't have the info on Luke and takes him make to what appears to be a space station very very very similar to the Death Star (how original Disney...). </P>
        <p> Meanwhile, one storm trooer, FN2187, is so upset about this mass killing. He doesn't stop Kylo Ren, but when they get back to the wanna-be Death Star he breaks out Poe and the two of them get away. Kylo Ren is even more angry... Poe names the ex storm trooper: Finn.</p>
          <figure><img src="finn.jpg" alt= "Ex-Storm Trooper FN2187 AKA Finn" width="400" height="225"/></br><figcaption>Ex-Storm Trooper FN2187 AKA Finn</figcaption> </Figure>
          <p>Then we meet our big hero. And YAY! She's a woman. Glad Disney finally figured out that strong female leads is important for the encouragement of more successful young women.</P>
            <figure><img src="rey.jpg" alt= "Our Wonderful Hero" width="450" height="225"/></br><figcaption>Rey: the Big Hero of the Movie</figcaption> </Figure> <p>Anyway, she is collecting parts on Joccu to sell for food. Shes very poor and on her own. (oooooh why does every hero have to go from rags to riches?) Then she runs into BB8 and everyone on Joccu freaks because he's some kind of rare gem.</P>
            <p>Kylo Ren freaks that Poe has left with a storm trooper, shoots them down, Finn is found alive, but by some magic Poe is no where to be found. STILL DON'T GET IT. Finn meets Rey and they run off trying to get away from Kylo Ren and the First Order. </P>
              <p>Now here's the part of the movie I have the biggest problem with: Rey can apparently fly the freaking Millennium Falcon which is on Joccu. Also, Han Solo has been apparently looking for the Millennium Falcon for decades and its been in a junk yard in a junk planet?</p>
              <p>It is revealed that Kylo Ren worships Darth Varder. He wears the mast to be dramatic. Also, he clearly did not see "Return of the Jedi" becaus Darth Varder became good after. Silly boy needs to watch all the movies before he can join the Dark Side</p>
              <p> Finn, Rey, and BB8 run away and get captured by Han Solo and Chewbacca. They make nice... Really Han Solo, you believe them? They go and meet up with people at a bar which is literally the exact same bar and scenery that was in a New Hope.</p>
              <p>Han Solo is alienated from General Leia...HOW can I have faith in any relationship? WOW POE IS ALIVE. why? why? why?</p>
              <p>Rey finds out Luke Skywalker's light saber is calling to her--Who is this chick? My theory: she is a product of the force like Anakin Skywalker was. It is the only thing that makes sense.</p>
              <p>Kylo Ren is the son of General Leia and Han Solo... that's why he's so dramatic. Kylo Ren attacks the planet they are all on, captures Rey. Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn go to the mega Death Star that is going to blow up planets using the power of the sun(WHAT?) to rescue her. She uses to the force to get away. Kylo Ren dramatically kills his dad. Chewbacca reacts just the way someone should if your best friend is killed in front of you. Finn and Rey fight Kylo Ren trying to get away using the light saber. Some how they win when they have no light saber skills at all. Chewbacca takes them back to the planet. </p>
              <p>Then General Leai sends Rey, again WHY HER? The movie ends with Luke Skywalker and Rey meeting, and dramatically, no words are exchanged. OOH CLIFF HANGER</p>
